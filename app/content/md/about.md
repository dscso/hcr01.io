#About us

We are working on this project in the context of [Jugend Forscht](http://www.jugend-forscht.de/). And yes, as you can see; we are from Germany, so a lot of our work is just available in German. sorry.

We are working on the [Lise-Meitner-Schule](http://osz-lise-meitner.eu/). Here we can use a vertical wind turbine and a few solar panels. With the energy we maybe will earn, we want to set up free WLAN ([Freifunk](https://freifunk.net/)) evreywhere in the school.
